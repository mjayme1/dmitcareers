                                        Are you interested in developing and maintaining websites which are client and customer focused? You may want to consider a career as a Web Developer!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Web Developers are responsible for programming the code that 'tells' a website how to function. They develop 'user friendly' websites, which means they are easy to navigate for those using them. They also build functions within a website — for example, a form to gather customer information, an input box for collecting emails to send newsletters, or a payment gateway to capture payment details.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Web Developers can be divided into two categories. A front-end Web Developer concentrates on the client side of the website to add aesthetic and functionality. Back-end developers are those who specialise in building up the back end of a website.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        One type of developer may focus on the client side to add style and functionality to the website itself (front-end developer) while another may focus on setting up the back end of a site (back-end developer). The work is typically very project-focused and involves collaborating with a team of people who help coordinate the client's needs with the end-product.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Work may also include meeting with clients to discuss their website requirements, or how they may improve their existing website. Web Developers construct the layout of a website, creating a visually interesting home page and user-friendly design, and may sometimes write content for the website. After a website is launched, developers ensure the website is working on all web browsers, testing and updating as needed.
                                    </p>

                                        A search engine optimization specialist (or SEO Specialist) is someone who analyzes a client's website and implements any necessary changes in order for it to be optimized for search engines. Search engine optimization specialists can be a company employee, an individual consultant, or can work for an SEO consulting firm.
