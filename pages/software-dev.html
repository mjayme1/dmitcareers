                                        <b>What is a Quality Assurance Analyst?</b> A Quality Assurance analyst is someone who ensures an organization's software is working properly. After the software developers build a program, Quality Assurance analysts test it. Software programs often freeze, don't work properly on certain operating systems, or may be missing key features. Quality Assurance analysts stop problems before they begin by working in a testing environment even before software is released to the public. This reduces any frustration and wasted time, and ultimately benefits the entire organization.

                                        If the developer is the fixer, the quality analyst is the finder. The ability to find and communicate errors in an application is a crucial role in software development.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The quality analyst (QA) seeks out not just application problems but also faults with a process that may have led to those problems. The QA also works with a development team to address those issues, ensuring a program is debugged prior to its launch. Here are five of the most important skills for an Quality Assurance Analyst are: 
                                    </p>

                                            <p>
                                                Great leadership requires a skill of the art of speaking with firm authority. A QA Analyst with such a personality is bound for rapid advancement in his career. Project managers are no longer in charge of projects; instead, QA is in charge of most choices, such as whether to go live or not. 
                                            </p>
                                        </li>

                                            <p>
                                                Despite the fact that testing is structured, it does not limit creativity. A QA Analyst is always creative and thinks outside the box. Creativity should be hemoglobins in a tester’s body. Testing methodologies can be used, but their usefulness is restricted without creativity. To improve their test coverage, QA Analysts' always thinks "what if I try this".
                                            </p>
                                        </li>

                                            <p>
                                                This skill is very critical for QA Analysts. If there was a superpower that all superheroes must-have, then it would be being detail orientated for QA Analysts. With great attention to detail, an analyst can pick up as many bugs as possible in a software system.

                                            <p>
                                                A good QA Analyst applies his experience in determining shortcomings in the live environment.  In layman's words, this means that an analyst anticipates areas where vulnerabilities are likely to occur and focuses his testing in those areas. They test with the perspective of an end-user to identify future issues and foresee risks when the application goes live.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                The mentality of good testers is finding a strategy to testing a given item from as many angles as possible. This also means being able to stand firm in the face of developers who refuse to fix bugs you've reported for no apparent reason. You should challenge with evidence, but it doesn't mean you have to be stubborn.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                However, if you are dissatisfied with the reasons for a bug rejection, you can appeal. You should keep questioning the rejection until you're pleased with it. Remember that QA's confidence in a feature determines whether or not it may be pushed to a live system.
